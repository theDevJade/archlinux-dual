# Starting Install: Windows

### If you're following this guide, I *assume* you have Windows installed, and have a pretty good knowledge of partitions, etc.

### Open the *Disk Manager*, and shrink the drive leaving the space you want to use for this installation.

## It is VERY important to note that you should have not have important files, there is a large chance this install will fail and you *will* lose data.
