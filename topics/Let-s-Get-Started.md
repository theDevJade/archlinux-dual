# Let&apos;s Get Started

## Prerequisites
- A USB drive with a valid *and* verified arch installation
- Correctly partitioned drive (Refer to [Starting Install: Windows](https://github.com/theDevJade/archlinux-dual.git) )
- Secure Boot *disabled* in the BIOS
- A good attitude (Of course)

<tip>
    <p>
        Never use archinstall
    </p>

## Lets-a-gooo

### The first thing you need to do (as with any OS) is boot into the USB!
I *assume* you know how, if you don't. **skill issue**.

<tip>
    <p>
        If ya have a big fancy monitor you can use <code>setfont ter-132n</code>
    </p>

### Internet
Just use ethernet, its not that hard (if your one of them wi-fi people you can refer to [the wiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Installation_guide))
